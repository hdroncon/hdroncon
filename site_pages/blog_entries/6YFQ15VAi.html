      <p>
        I have discussed — and will continue to discuss — in other posts my passion for building applications and the challenges involved in designing good user interfaces, or <i>graphical user interfaces</i> (GUIs). Generally, application logic and objectives are independent of the GUI, so during the conceptualization and scope definition phases of a project, I usually don’t encounter major issues. However, developing the GUI often becomes the bottleneck in the creation process.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        An interesting option for building applications is provided by Microsoft: <b>Power Apps</b>. In a nutshell, this paid tool (available through Microsoft 365 licenses) allows for the (almost) intuitive creation of visually appealing applications that can interact with external data sources (such as third-party databases) or with Microsoft’s own tools, like <b>Access</b>, <b>Power Automate</b>, and <b>Sharepoint</b>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Power Apps enables users with little or no programming experience to develop functional applications. This is largely due to its visual, <i>drag-and-drop</i> interface and its ability to connect to basic data sources, such as a simple SharePoint list (which can be loosely compared to an online Excel spreadsheet). The overall interface is user-friendly, and the learning curve is relatively quick. Developers using this platform can quickly enhance their skills and deliver better results in a short amount of time.

        LIMS
      </p></span>
      <p>
        <b>Laboratory Information Management Systems</b> (LIMS) are used across various industry sectors, with their primary goal being the effective management of laboratory samples and associated data. The importance of a robust and well-implemented LIMS cannot be overstated. Beyond <b>reducing costs</b> and <b>increasing productivity</b> in sample management processes, LIMS also enhances <b>quality control</b> and <b>compliance with regulatory standards</b> — a critical factor in industries such as pharmaceuticals and food production.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Using LIMS software to manage samples enables not only individual sample tracking but also batch and lot control. For instance, it facilitates the tracking of large volumes of samples in the event of a product recall. It also streamlines the generation of results, ensuring fast and efficient access to information for internal teams conducting analyses, as well as for clients who require quick, reliable access to reports. Providing clients with transparency and confidence that every step — from sample collection to report delivery — is rigorously monitored significantly improves their overall experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Gradually feeding data into the system’s databases allows for medium- and long-term analysis of the laboratory’s internal operations. This helps identify areas for optimization, ensures that appropriate tests are being applied to the right samples, and supports predictive insights through trend analysis. In summary, LIMS greatly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of laboratory operations by standardizing procedures and managing data and their interdependencies.

        HR Blood Laboratory
      </p></span>
      <p>
        To explore the features of Power Apps, I developed the <b>HR Blood Laboratory</b> app, a European company that collects blood samples from patients and conducts various tests with them.
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
        <img src="blog_images_01-10/6YFQ15VA_01.png" onclick="onClick(this)" style="border-radius: 10px; width: 50%; cursor: pointer; transition: 0.3s;">

      </div>
      <br>
      
      <p>
        From the home page, we first go to the <b>Standards</b> section. Here, the (fictional) tests applicable to the samples collected from patients are displayed. There is a basic filter that allows you to check specific tests, as well as the possibility to edit an existing test or add a new one. Registering new tests is done through the <i>6897-DIY-HRBL2</i> form, which includes all the necessary data to add it to the database. Editing the data of a test is done through the <i>1989-DIY-HRBL2</i> form; however, the layout is the same for adding new tests. The difference between the forms is to demonstrate that the <i>create</i> and <i>edit</i> commands in the database are done independently.
      </p>

        Starting again from the home page, we have the <b>Patients</b> section. Here, according to the filter on the right, the patients registered in the company's database are displayed. Initially, HR Blood Laboratory's scope is limited to Europe, specifically Germany, Belgium, and England. From this page, you can navigate to the tab for adding new patients to the database (<i>New</i> button), adding a new sample associated with the patient (<i>New sample</i> button), viewing the patient's sample and test history (Historic button), or editing the patient's record (<i>Edit</i> button).
      </p>

        New patient registration is done through form <i>5205-DIY-HRBL2</i>, and editing the data of a selected patient is carried out using form <i>6388-DIY-HRBL2</i>, following the same logic used in the <b>Standards</b>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When clicking <i>New sample</i>, the user is taken to form <i>5113-DIY-HRBL2</i>, which is used to register a new blood sample associated with that patient. Here, the user must provide the collection date, the test to which the sample is being submitted, and the test value. As a helpful tip, the normal value range for the selected test type is displayed to the user. A unique <i>barcode</i> is generated for the sample, based on the sample ID, the date the sample was added to the database, the test ID, and the patient ID. An interesting detail I didn’t use in this project is that SharePoint automatically records the user who added the new entry, based on the login used in the app — which allows for efficient tracking of data insertions.

        The <i>Historic</i> tab displays all samples/tests associated with the selected patient. Using the filters, users can check whether there are samples awaiting validation, approved, rejected, with normal or abnormal results — based on the acceptable range defined by the standard applied to each specific sample.

        By clicking the <i>Print info</i> icon, the user is taken to a page with a different layout from the others (form <i>389-DIY-HRBL2</i>), which contains all relevant information about the sample — the person responsible for the test, who validated it, whether the sample is valid, its result, as well as details about the user generating the form and the date of generation. Clicking <i>Print</i> allows the form to be printed or saved as a PDF, already formatted for A4.

        To implement a security measure, all samples entered into the system must be validated — preferably by a different user than the one who registered the sample, for verification and auditing purposes. In the <b>Samples</b> section, all samples in the database are listed, and filters can be used to check their status. Here, instead of displaying the patient’s name, it is preferable to show the patient ID, making the process more neutral and less personal.

        When clicking <i>Approve/Discard</i>, the user reviews the information and either approves or rejects the sample via form <i>5256-DIY-HRBL2</i>. Since the test value was already entered during the sample registration, the user here simply checks whether the system is correctly evaluating the result — the <i>Result</i> field is automatic: it compares the <i>Test value</i> with the reference range and returns <i>Normal</i> if it falls within the range, or <i>Altered</i> if it is outside. The <i>Print info</i> button redirects to form <i>389-DIY-HRBL2</i>.

        Power Apps primarily focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for data input. However, it also offers (limited) functionality for displaying data stored in the databases. In the <b>Dashboard</b> section, a few examples of charts that can be created using Power Apps’ native features are presented. Depending on how the charts are configured, they can automatically update as soon as new data is entered into the application — which is intuitive and relatively simple to implement once you’re familiar with the plotting methods.

        Final thoughts
      </p></span>
      <p>
        As previously mentioned, the application requires a minimal structure to function. In this case, I used three SharePoint lists: patients, samples, and tests, named intuitively and directly related to the sections described earlier. I aimed to link them through their IDs, allowing navigation between them without the need to merge the data into a single list or create a consolidated dataset containing all the necessary information.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        All the features used here were part of a proof of concept, so the application is not optimized and contains some redundancies. Still, even in a test environment, it’s worth noting that it is highly recommended to connect a Power BI dashboard to SharePoint lists (used as a database). Power BI offers a much higher quality and quantity of resources for visualization and analysis. The connection is also very simple to set up, significantly enhancing the visibility of the data and enabling more informed, data-driven decision-making based on the information fed through the application.
